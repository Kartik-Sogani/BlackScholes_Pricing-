# BlackScholes_Pricing-

This project implements the **Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model** to price European call and put options. It also visualizes option prices across different strike prices and time-to-expiration values using heatmaps.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

The Black-Scholes model is a fundamental concept in quantitative finance, used to determine the theoretical price of European-style options.

This project includes:
- Calculation of European call and put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Estimation of **Implied Volatility**.
- Visualization of pricing surfaces using **heatmaps**.
- Python implementation with a clear and modular structure.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- ðŸ“Š Computes option prices given inputs: stock price, strike price, time to maturity, volatility, and interest rate.
- ðŸ“‰ Supports implied volatility calculation using numerical methods.
- ðŸ”¥ Generates heatmaps of call/put option prices over a range of strikes and maturities.
- ðŸ§  Demonstrates understanding of stochastic processes and risk-neutral valuation.
